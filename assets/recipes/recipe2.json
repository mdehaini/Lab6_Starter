Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cook, covered, 1 minute. Remove from heat and let sit, covered, 14 minutes, then rinse under cold water. Crack shells and carefully peel under cool running water. Halve eggs lengthwise. Spoon out yolks into a small bowl and place whites on a serving platter. Using a fork, mash yolks, then stir in mayonnaise, lemon juice, and Dijon and season with salt and pepper. Spoon mixture evenly among egg whites and smooth top.  Carefully dust paprika all over yolk mixture, completely covering yolk. Use a sharp paring knife to make ridges down the paprika-dusted yolk to look like a pumpkin. Place chive above egg mixture to look like a stem and serve.","video":[],"recipeCuisine":["American"],"aggregateRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":3.6,"reviewCount":5,"worstRating":1,"bestRating":5},"review":[{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Review","datePublished":"2020-11-26","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"Kitcaine"},"reviewBody":"These were delicious and look just like pumpkins! I made them for Halloween and made them again for Thanksgiving. Thank you. \n\nAlso, if you want to add a little something extra, add a piece of bacon at the bottom of the egg before you add the yolk mixture. Delicious!","reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1,"bestRating":5}},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Review","datePublished":"2020-11-26","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"nik6685"},"reviewBody":"I made these today and clearly used too much lemon! It would be nice to have an actual measurement rather than \u201cjuice of half a lemon\u201d. My feedback, use a splash of lemon otherwise your mixture will be runny and not taste good! Such a.
